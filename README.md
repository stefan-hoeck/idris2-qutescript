# idris2-qutescript: Writing user scripts for qutebrowser

The [qutebrowser](https://qutebrowser.org/) is keyboard-focused browser
with a nice API for writing and invoking user scripts.

This library provides some types and utilities for writing such
user scripts in Idris2. It was originally based on a similar library
written in Python: [python-qutescript](https://github.com/hiway/python-qutescript).
